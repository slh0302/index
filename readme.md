 The detector uses caffe's Python layer and some related Python programs, so you must ensure the following two paths have been written to your .zshrc or .bashrc:
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/xieqiang/Documents/Code/Detection/py-faster-rcnn-master/lib
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/xieqiang/Documents/Code/Detection/py-faster-rcnn-master/caffe-fast-rcnn/python
	
That's all!
